# Viewport Units Buggyfill™

It adds a variety of fixes to support 
IE9+, iOS6 for Safari and viewport units inside CSS3 calc() expressions (see changelog for details).

This script makes viewport units (vh|vw|vmin|vmax) work properly in Mobile Safari and IE9+.

This is a *buggyfill* (fixing bad behavior), not a *polyfill* (adding missing behavior). If the browser doesn't know how to deal with the [viewport units](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths) - `vw`, `vh`, `vmin` and `vmax` - it won't gain the capability through this script, because this buggyfill uses the [CSSOM](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/) to access the defined styles.

It does, however, accomodate browsers that have partial, but not full support for vmin/vmax units.

The buggyfill iterates through all defined styles the document knows and extracts those that uses a viewport unit. After resolving the relative units against the viewport's dimensions, CSS is put back together and injected into the document in a `<style>` element. Listening to the `orientationchange` event allows the buggyfill to update the calculated dimensions accordingly.

> Note: This buggyfill only works on stylesheets! viewport units used in `style` attributes are *not* resolved.

## Using viewport-units-buggyfill

After loading the buggyfill from npm (`npm install viewport-units-buggyfill`) or bower (`bower install viewport-units-buggyfill`), it has to be required and initialized:

```js
require('viewport-units-buggyfill').init();
```

If you're - for whatever reason - not using a package manager, include the script as follows:

```html
<script src="viewport-units-buggyfill.js"></script>
<script>window.viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init();</script>
```

## API

`viewport-units-buggyfill` exposes the following API:

```js
var viewportUnitsBuggyfill = require('viewport-units-buggyfill');

// find viewport-unit declarations,
// convert them to pixels,
// inject style-element into document,
// register orientationchange event (and resize events in IE9+) to repeat when necessary
// will only engage for Mobile Safari on iOS and IE9+
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init();

// ignore user agent force initialization
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init({force: true});

// reduces the amount of times the buggyfill is reinitialized on window resize in IE
// for performance reasons.
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init({use_resize_debounce: 250});

// allows the use of css hacks inside the CSS content property
// for iOS Safari. This includes vmax (iOS6 Safari) 
// as well as viewport units in calc expressions (iOS Safari).
// See changelog for version 0.4 to see details on how this works.  
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init({use_css_content_hack: true});

// allows the use of css hacks inside the CSS behavior property
// for IE9+. This includes vmax units
// as well as viewport units in calc expressions involving vmin
// and vmax.
// See changelog for version 0.4 to see details on how this works.
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init({use_css_content_hack: true});

// update internal declarations cache and recalculate pixel styles
// this is handy when you add styles after .init() was run
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.refresh();

// you can do things manually (without the style-element injection):
// identify all declarations using viewport units
viewportUnitsBuggyfill.findProperties();
var cssText = viewportUnitsBuggyfill.getCss();
```

## Cross Origin Stylesheets

**Warning:** Including stylesheets from third party services, like Google WebFonts, requires those resources to be served with appropriate CORS headers. 

## Changelog

### 0.4 (July 10th 2014) ###

* fixes IE9 and Safari native way of calculating viewport units differently inside of a frame. Without this buggyfill, IE9 will assume the `100vw` and `100vh` to be the width and height of the parent document’s viewport, while Safari for iOS will choose 1px (!!!!) for both.
* fixes IE9's issue when calculate viewport units correctly when changing media-query breakpoints.
* adds `vmin` support for IE9 (instead of `vm`, IE9's equivalent to vmin)  and `vmax` support to IE9 and 10. (Note that this will only work when initializing with `viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init({use_css_behavior_hack: true});`)
```css
.myLargeBlock {
    
  /* Non-IE browsers */
  width: 50vmin;
  height: 50vmax;
  
  /* IE9 and 10 */
  behavior: 'use_css_behavior_hack: true; width: 50vmin; height: 50vmax;';

}
```
* adds the ability for viewport units to be used inside of calc() expressions in iOS Safari and IE9+, via the use of the `content` CSS property.  This seems like a good compromise since `content` is only valid inside `::before` and `::after` rules (as a result, it is not recommended use this hack inside of these rules).  (Note that this will only work when initializing with `viewportUnitsBuggyfill.init({use_css_content_hack: true});`)
```css
.box {
  
  top: calc(50vh -  100px );
  left: calc(50vw -  100px );
  /*
   * Here is the code for WebKit browsers that will allow 
   * viewport-units-buggyfill.js to perform calc on viewport
   * units. 
   */
  content: 'use_css_content_hack: true; top: calc(50vh -  100px ); left: calc(50vw -  100px );';
}
```
* Using the above 'use_css_content_hack' trick, one can also add support for vmax support in Safari for the older iOS6 
* Adds support for viewport units inside of IE's `filter` property (a.k.a. Visual Filters).
* Added debounce initialization parameter, if it is desirable to not have IE9+ fire the polyfill so many times on a resize event.
